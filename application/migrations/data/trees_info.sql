The large, heart-shaped fruit has firm, meaty, purple-red flesh with a semi-free stone. Bing cherry is especially sensitive to local site conditions. The best growth is in light, sandy soil that is well drained, but receives adequate rain or irrigation through dry periods. At least 6-8 hours of daily sunlight are needed. The fruit is somewhat susceptible to cracking. Sweet cherry culture is most successful in cooler, drier climates where the danger of late frost is limited, and rain does not fall during harvest. Plant early in the season, because leaf buds open early and the roots are slower than those in many trees to get established.  Successful pollination is necessary for a good crop.

The forsythia tolerates a wide range of soils except permanently wet or exceptionally dry soil. The forsythia will flower best in full sun to partial shade. After a period of time, the forsythia will need pruning and moderate maintenance. Forsythias bloom on wood grown in the previous year. For this reason, pruning should be done in the spring immediately after flowering. The flower buds develop during the summer and fall, and fall pruning will remove them. However, if the buds are already formed, necessary pruning can be done 4-6 weeks before flowering time, and the pruned branches can be forced indoors. Pruning should follow the natural habit of the shrub removing old or dead wood. Cutting the older branches to the ground every year will cause new shoots to grow from the roots and renew the shrub.

Japanese plum trees have a rougher bark and more persistant spurs than European plums. They also are more vigorous, disease resistant, and produce more flowers. They tolerate heat and need only a short period of winter dormancy. The early bloom time makes them susceptible to late spring frosts. The foliage is bright green. The white flowers are borne mostly in umbel-like clusters of 2-3 on short spurs, and solitary or 2-3 in axils of 1-yr-old wood. Blooms appear as early as February covered in snow. Fruiting begins in 2-4 years. Methley plum produces heavy, annual crops of juicy, sweet, red purple fruit that ripens from late May to early July. One crop requires several pickings. Japanese plums can be picked before they are completely ripe, since they will finish ripening off the tree. Methley is self fertile and serves as a good pollinator for early bearing Japanese varieties. Japanese and European plums cannot cross-pollinate each other, because they have different numbers of chromosomes. The growth rate is 15-20 inches per year. Plums require minimal pruning which should be done after flowering when the tree is still leafless. In the formative years, pruning can be to remove interior branches, water sprouts, growing scaffold branches, and dead, damaged, or diseased wood.

The bark is light brown and thin, and the wood itself is weak.The trumpet shaped flowers are 2-4\\\" across in colors of white, pink, red, violet or purple. They stay open for one day and close at night. Single-flowered varieties are hardier than the double-flowered types. The roots are located just below the soil surface. This shrub is tolerant of many soil textures, moisture conditions, and acid to alkaline pH if it is in full or nearly full sun. However, it requires ample moisture and some protection from midday to afteroon sun to flower at it\'s best.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe shrub will keep its upright form as it grows, so little pruning is required. While shaping or pruning can be done at any time, pruning in late winter or early spring will minimize the loss of the emerging flower buds on the new growth. Pruning heavily in early spring or pruning back to 2-3 buds will produce fewer but larger flowers. It can be pruned to to create a single trunk small specimen tree.  Transplanting should be done in the spring as the shrub takes some time to get established.

The large, thick green leaves have 3-5 deep lobes with little or slight yellow color change in the fall. The fruits are hairy, brown seed balls about 1\\\" diameter that hang in groups of 2-7.  At the base of the trunk, the bark is thick, rough and furrowed, dark gray or brown. Above, it is thin, smooth, ashy white, and flakes or peels off to show mottled colors of white, tan, and brown. The California sycamore tolerates many soil textures including acidic, alkaline, compacted, and wet. It has only moderate tolerance to salt and drought when well established.
