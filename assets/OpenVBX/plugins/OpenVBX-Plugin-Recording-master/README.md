## Usage

Once installed, New applets will appear on the sidebar when you create flows. You will also see a new page appear on the sidebar.

### Applets

#### Dial Record

This works exactly the same way as the standard Dial applet with a few additional features:

* You have the option of telling the caller something before the dial happens. This is useful for "call may be recorded" messages.
* You can record the dial as it is ringing or when it is answered. It is recommended that you wait until the call is answered.

### Pages

####Recorded Calls

This page allows you to listen to calls that were recorded.

There are several things to be aware of when using this page:

* Accounts with large numbers of recordings may take a while to completely load the page.
  This is due to the limitations of the Twilio API.
* Any new recordings will show up within 5 minutes of the call completing.
* Outbound call recordings do not currently display unless the flow they are sent to uses one of the dial applets to complete another call.

### Future Development

Watch the [develop branch] [3] if you are interested in testing new features.
If you really can't wait for a develop build, check the feature branches for alpha versions. These are not guaranteed to work properly.
