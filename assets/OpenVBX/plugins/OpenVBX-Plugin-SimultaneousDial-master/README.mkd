# README

This plugin adds a "Simultaneous Dial" applet. This works exactly like the
built-in Dial applet (as of this writing), except that group dialing is
performed with all members being dialed simultaneously. The first person to pick
up "wins" the call.

# INSTALLATION

Do the following:

    cd ~/OpenVBX/plugins
    wget http://github.com/zostay/OpenVBX-Plugin-SimultaneousDial/tarball/OpenVBX-Plugin-SimultaneousDial-0.01
    tar zxf zostay-OpenVBX-Plugin-SimultaneousDial-OpenVBX-Plugin-SimultaneousDial-0.01-0-ga022727.tar.gz

Now, go into your flow diagrams and start using it.

Done.
